Ask the Dealer: What Does “Split” and “Double Down” Mean in Blackjack?
https://www.islandresortandcasino.com/blog/ask-the-dealer-what-does-double-down-mean-in-blackjack

Good BlackJack Split and Double Down Info
https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/

Round 1: 1 card face up each
Round 2: 1 card for player only, face down card for dealer
Round x: player hits until stays
last round: dealer flips up card, then if under 16 they keep hitting until stay or bust


winnings:
1.5X for hitting blackjack with 2 cards on 2nd round
2X for dealer bust or higher yield than dealer


TODO

// - in case of getting a blackjack should probably have the option of hitting
// - add thread.sleep like delay each time dealer hits card
// have a display arrow on the split spacer card going towards the active hand
// bet display at the end of losing/winning a split
